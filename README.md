Application for monitoring the appearance of a company on Twitter (with Twitter API)

Mihai Lupu 22.01.2022: It should be specified that, in accordance with what was stated in the video, when I pushed the frontend today, it put everything back on a master branch, meaning that it is possible to notice changes in the hours at which the commit was made. It was just a personal mistake and please forgive me. Also, throughout today you appeared as a contributor and now that I have posted everything at the end, you no longer appear on the right, but if I go to setting collaborators, I find you there for this repository. In case you don't see the repo, I will submit the documents necessary for quick remediation. Thanks

Dragomir Denis-Alexandru: Am verificat partea de backend. Prezentarea mi-a dat pe alocuri impresia ca proiectul nu este realizat de tine. In orice caz, nu ai prezentat cazuri de eroare si nici interactiunea cu baza de date.
Punctaj - backend: 0,8 / 1,5
Punctaj - frontend: TBD
Punctaj total (pentru zonele necompletate, pana la evaluare, se ia in considerare punctajul maxim): 3,3 / 4
